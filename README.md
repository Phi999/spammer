# spammer
This script will allow you to spam wherever your cursor is!

Works only with installed PyAutoGUI (pip3 install pyautogui)

How to use
-----------------------------------

Firstly, you need to choose a spam mode:
***
 ~ Your text and your length;

 ~ Random text and your length;

 ~ Random text and length;

 ~ Text from "text.txt" file (allows you to spam lines from songs)
 ***
 
Next, if you choose 1-3 options, you need to enter the information required by the script.

Also, if you choose to spam text from a file, you need to put the text itself in that file ("text.txt", it should be in the folder with the script).

When the script says you have 5 seconds - during that time you have to put the cursor where you want to start spamming. The time passes and the spam begins
